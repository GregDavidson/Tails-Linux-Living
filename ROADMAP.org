* Tails Linux Living /Project Roadmap/

The directory structure shown here appears excessively complex because
it is only a small subset of the full structure of my actual Gnu/Linux
home!

** DONE Populate =~= and =~/Desktop=

Tails has a mechanism for populating files under =~= but it is
somewhat inflexible.  Tails also provides an imnsho excessively long
=.bashrc= file.  I prefer a more modular solution.  I also prefer to
manage /everything/ with =git=.

- [[file:Links/HomeLinks/.bash_profile][.bash_profile]]
- [[file:Links/HomeLinks/.bashrc][.bashrc]]
- [[file:SW/Config/Bin/restore-dotfiles][restore-dotfiles]]
