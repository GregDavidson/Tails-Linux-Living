* Living Well Inside Tails Gnu/Linux

For some time I've wanted to build a Gnu/Linux environment which was
- Entirely resident on a USB Thumbdrive
- Secure and private, like Tails
- Everything I do should persist on the Thumbdrive
    - projects
    - packages
    - customizations

Given the available USB Thumbdrives
    - 500GB for $50!
there is no reason why a Gnu/Linux environment living on such can't be
every bit as good as a normally installed Gnu/Linux environment.

Alas, [[file:tails-issues.org][Tails presents obstacles]] for using it this way.

This project is an attempt to overcome these obstacles!

As I overcome various obstacles to achieving these goals I intend to
document them here.

Here's my [[file:ROADMAP.org][Project Roadmap]].

It's also still not clear if I'm going to be able to fully achieve my
goals.  An alternative would be to use a more ordinary Gnu/Linux
distribution in encrypted partitions and add tor, etc.
